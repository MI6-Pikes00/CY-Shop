The program allows you to choose between three modes. The gestion mode, the purchase mode or the customer mode.

### Gestion Mode
The gestion mode allows you to display and increase current stocks within the limits of available space *(100 places)*.

### Purchase Mode
The purchase mode allows you to make purchases using your customer account. It can also allow you to search fo products in stock using their name or reference number.

### Customer Mode
The customer mode only allows you to delete your customer account from the database.
